For front end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript & React

I also used Python to build a backend API, it's called [CramHub](https://github.com/NeggFriedRice/CramHub), and a terminal-based text-game [BeyBlade Battle Sim](https://github.com/NeggFriedRice/beyblade-battle-sim), check them out!

### Things I'm currently working on üí°
- Building out my [CARtificate](https://github.com/NeggFriedRice/cartificate-frontend) app (built with React) and turn it into something people can actually use!
- Level 6 and 7 kyu Python challenges on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/trainer/python)
