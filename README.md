## Hello there, I'm Tom! 🤖 | thomasloo.dev

Thanks for stopping by! I'm a Junior Full Stack Web Developer based in Melbourne hoping to make my mark on the world 🌏.

### Current toolbox 🧰
For front end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript & React

For backend we've got: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB

I also used Python to build a backend API, it's called [CramHub](https://github.com/NeggFriedRice/CramHub), and a terminal-based text-game [BeyBlade Battle Sim](https://github.com/NeggFriedRice/beyblade-battle-sim), check them out!

### Things I'm currently working on 💡
- Building out my [CARtificate](https://github.com/NeggFriedRice/cartificate-frontend) app (built with React) and turn it into something people can actually use!
